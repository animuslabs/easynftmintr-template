# Easy NFT Minter example template

## Introduction
This template project provides a base for you to build a custom NFT minting portal. This Antelope Contract + Vue Frontend enables you to provide an interface for users to mint NFTs from your collection at prices which are determined by a smart contract. You can easily customize the project to support any token for payment.

## Features

### Smart Contract
Register any number of templates which can be purchased by the user. Each registered template can determine it's payment token/price.

### Frontend
The frontend provides a simple interface for users to mint NFTs. It displays the available templates and allows users to mint NFTs by paying the required amount of tokens with the click of a button. Users can also view their inventory of minted NFTs.

## Ideas for extending this project
- Extend the contract to modify the price of a template over time or each time one is minted.
- Add a feature which requires users to burn or stake one NFT in order to mint another.
- Add the ability for users to create their own NFTs from a template and customize it.
